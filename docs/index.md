# Welcome to SqlIntuitive
---
SqlIntuitive is a Python library to make database stuff easier.
It offers a way to perform database transactions with no need to write any SQL statements as those will be generated automatically.
Another advantage is the ability to store any Python object you want to inside a database.
Currently only MySQL and SqLite are supported, but more will come in the future and contributing is most welcome.
